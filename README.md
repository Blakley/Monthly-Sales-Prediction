# Predicting Monthly Sales for a Superstore
- <b>Goal</b> : The goal of this project was to build a regression model to predict monthly sales from a superstore.
- We use [Nearest Neighbors Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor.html) to make the predictions.
- To evaluate the performance of the model, we use the evaluation: metric [R-squared score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html).
